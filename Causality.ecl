/**
  * Causal Model Module.
  *
  * Causal level methods require a combination of a causal model, and a dataset.
  *
  * Methods include:
  * - ValidateModel -- Analyze the data against the provided causal model and
  *         evaluate the degree of correspondence between the two.
  * - Causal (or Probabilistic) Query.  This is a superset of probability queries,
  *     adding  support for causal interventions  that simulate the effect on a target variable of a causal 
  *     intervention on one or more variable.  See Query for details.
  * - Metrics -- Evaluate various causal metrics on desgnated pairs 
  *      [source, destination] of variables.
  * - DiscoverModel -- Utilize a range of causal discovery methods to discover causal relationships
  *      between variables.
  *
  * @param mod A causal model in DATASET(cModel) format.  The dataset should
  *    contain only a single record, defining the model.
  * @param PS The id of a Probability Space or Subspace containing the
  *    dataset. This is obtained by <probabilityInstance>.PS, or as returned from
  *    a probability.SubSpace() call.
  *
  * @see Types.cModel
  * @see ML_Core.Types.NumericField
